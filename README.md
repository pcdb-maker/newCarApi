# New Car API

This project is an API designed to provide information about new cars, including specifications, pricing, and availability. It allows users to query different car models, manufacturers, and categories, offering an efficient way to retrieve detailed automotive data for various applications such as car comparison websites, dealerships, or consumer research tools.

## Features

### 1. Car Model Search
The API allows users to search for car models by name, manufacturer, or category. Users can retrieve specific information about each car, including engine specs, fuel efficiency, safety ratings, and more.

### 2. Manufacturer Information
Users can query detailed information about car manufacturers, including the history of the brand, available models, and regional availability. This feature is useful for exploring different car brands and comparing what they offer.

### 3. Price Lookup
The API provides up-to-date pricing information for new cars, including base prices, optional features, and regional pricing differences. This allows users to compare car prices across different regions and configurations.

### 4. Car Categories and Filters
Users can filter results by car categories such as sedans, SUVs, electric vehicles, or luxury cars. The API also includes additional filtering options for fuel types, transmission types, and more, making it easy to narrow down search results.

### 5. Availability Status
The API includes information on the availability of car models, such as whether a model is in production, available for purchase, or discontinued. This helps users identify which cars are currently on the market.

### 6. Fuel Efficiency and Emissions Data
For each car, the API provides data on fuel efficiency (miles per gallon or liters per 100 kilometers) and CO2 emissions, which can be useful for environmentally conscious buyers or for meeting regulatory requirements.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Node.js and Express for building the API endpoints.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing and managing car data.
- **API Documentation**: Swagger for generating interactive API documentation and testing.
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure API access and user authentication.
- **Deployment**: Vercel for API hosting and deployment.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /cars**: Retrieve a list of all cars or filter by parameters such as model, manufacturer, and category.
- **GET /cars/:id**: Retrieve detailed information about a specific car by its ID.
- **GET /manufacturers**: Get a list of all car manufacturers and their details.
- **GET /manufacturers/:id**: Retrieve detailed information about a specific manufacturer by its ID.
- **GET /cars/availability**: Check the availability status of a specific car model.
- **POST /cars**: Add a new car model to the database (requires authentication).
- **PUT /cars/:id**: Update information about a specific car model (requires authentication).
- **DELETE /cars/:id**: Delete a car model from the database (requires authentication).

## Usage

The New Car API allows developers and businesses to integrate car data into their applications. Common use cases include car comparison tools, dealership websites, or research platforms.

### API Documentation

Interactive API documentation is available through Swagger, allowing developers to test endpoints, view request/response formats, and see all available parameters and filters.

## Future Enhancements

Planned future updates and improvements include:

- **Electric Vehicle (EV) Data**: Adding more comprehensive data for electric vehicles, including charging times, battery life, and charging station locations.
- **User Reviews**: Allowing users to submit and retrieve reviews for specific car models.
- **Inventory Management**: Integrating inventory management for dealerships to track car availability in real-time.
